Did you ever ask yourself where those creatures came from?
Like, spirits and stuff like that are obviously just the souls of dead people.

By golems are man-made creatures!
Who made them? What is their goal?
They don't attack the town citizens, so are they just here to protect us?
Protect us from whom?
