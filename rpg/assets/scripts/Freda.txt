Hi!
I'm the quest giver!
I give quests!
That's my job!
Can you hand me your questmenu so I can enter the first step of a 40h storyline?
What!?!
You don't have a questmenu? 
This is an open ended experience?
Well ... I guess life generally doesn't have a goal either, so that's fine ...
Still, you should check out the wasteland.
New monst-...
eh ... creatures and stuff.
Maybe you want to kill them too!
You murderer!
