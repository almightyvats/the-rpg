It's dangerous to go alone! Take this!
To go where, you ask?
The town, obviously!
Don't you see all the monsters around here!
Use our inventory (I) to equip your combatants with weapons and other useful items.
Cross the river and follow the road to reach the town.
Make sure that the people there are safe!
If you don't want to reset to the start in case you lose ...
... save the game (O) from time to time.
