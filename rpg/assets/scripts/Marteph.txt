Do you wonder how I got these scars?
You see, I was once a killer like you.
But then I realized, that there's actually no point to any of this.
We live in a society!
But what actually constitutes a society?
What's point of running around, handling tasks, killing monsters?
Is it just see your stats go up, your bank balance rise?
Or is it for the satisfaction of living itself?
What does it actually mean to live?
Do I live right now?
Do you live right now?
What makes my existance in this world less valuable than yours?
From my perspective you're the expendable one!
The NPC in a game.
An insignificant part of something bigger ...
