Stop right there, adventurer!
I am the guardian of the wasteland behind me and you cannot pass!
Why am I guarding a wasteland?
None of your f***ing business!
To make sure that no one passes, I created an invisible barrier!
You will never be able to pass it!
Unless one of your combatants reaches level 10 or higher.
In this case you could probably pass it.
Maybe I should invest into a better barrier ...
