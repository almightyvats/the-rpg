There are multiple different equipment classes.
Each class brings different potential attacks, abilities and bonus stats.
This results in different strengths, weaknesses and usages.
Swords are balanced melee weapons that offer a variety of attacks ...
... with different cooldowns and damage outputs.
Axes bring higher average damage and can offer bonus strength, ...
... but for the tradeoff of higher cooldowns.
As ranged weapons, bow represent a consistent damage output in the hands of ...
... a skilled user against enemies with low perception.
Shields are pure defensive items that offer bonuses to the defense stat.
Finally, potions are items that offer healing abilities that can be used indefinitely.
Think closely about which of combatants should carry which combination of items.
