You don't get the story?
Why?
It's so obvious!
You see, this is all an elaborate social commentary ...
... on the utter meaninglessness of our entire existance, ...
... the socio-economic factors of gender inequality, ...
... the reluctant nature of the AAA videogame industry in regards to innovation, ...
... the staleness of the current League meta, ...
... and the greatness of the allmighty Kunihiku Ikuhara!
You're really stupid for not picking that up by yourself!
